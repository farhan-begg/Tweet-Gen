One more drink of one more Bacardi
One more dance at this after party
We still going, going strong
(Going, going strong, going, going strong)
Speed so fast like a Ferrari
We get wild like a safari
We still going, going strong
(Going, going strong, going, going strong)
And none of these good things, good things, good things
All we need, good things, good things, good things
Tonight, we go all night long
We party like Post Malone
Don't tell me to go-o-o
Yeah, we are never, ever going home, tonight
Ain't nobody kill my vibe
Don't tell me to go-o-o
Yeah, we are never, ever going home
Yeah, we are never, ever going home
Yeah, we are never, ever going home
See the ocean there in your eyes
In slow motion, we see the sun rise
We are, we are in a zone
Five a.m. and we still are rolling
In the deepest of my emotions
We are, we are in a zone
And none of these good things, good things, good things
All we need, good things, good things, good things
Tonight, we go all night long
We party like Post Malone
Don't tell me to go-o-o
Yeah, we are never, ever going home, tonight
Ain't nobody kill my vibe
Don't tell me to go-o-o
Yeah, we are never, ever going home
Yeah, we are never, ever going home
Yeah, we are never, ever going home
Tonight, we go all night long
We party like Post Malone
Don't tell me to go-o-o
Yeah, we are never, ever going home, tonight
Ain't nobody kill my vibe
Don't tell me to go-o-o
Yeah, we are never, ever going home
yeah, we are never, ever going home
Never, ever going home
Yeah, we are never, ever going home
Hahahahaha

Ayy, I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (star)
Ayy, ayy, all my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, name them the shottas
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (pow, pow, pow)

Ayy, ayy, switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', "Rest in peace to Bon Scott"
Ayy, close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison
Ayy, act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car
Ayy, shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', "I'm with the band"
Ayy, ayy, now she actin' outta pocket
Tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend
Yeah, ayy

Ayy, ayy, I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (star)
Ayy, ayy, all my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, name them the shottas
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (pow, pow, pow)

I've been in the Hills fuckin' superstars
Feelin' like a popstar (21, 21, 21)
Drankin' Henny, bad bitches jumpin' in the pool
And they ain't got on no bra (no bra)
Hit her from the back, pullin' on her tracks
And now she screamin' out, "no m√°s" (yeah, yeah, yeah)
They like "Savage, why you got a 12 car garage and you only got 6 cars?" (21)
I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that? (kiss that?)
Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack (big snack)
Green hundreds in my safe, I got old racks (old racks)
L.A. bitches always askin', "Where the coke at?" (21, 21)
Livin' like a rockstar, smash out on a cop car
Sweeter than a Pop-Tart, you know you are not hard
I done made the hot chart, 'member I used to trap hard
Livin' like a rockstar, I'm livin' like a rockstar

Ayy, I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (star)
Ayy, ayy, all my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, name them the shottas
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta (grrra-ta-ta-ta)
