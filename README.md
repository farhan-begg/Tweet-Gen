## Project Description

A project based course that looks under the hood at data structures and algorithms to see how they work. In addition to implementing these structures in an application; I build them from scratch, analyzed their complexity, and benchmarked their performance to gain an understanding of their tradeoffs and when to use them in practice. I wrote scripts, functions, and library modules to use text processing tools like regular expressions, construct and sample probability distributions to create a Markov language model and gain insight into how grammar works and natural language processing techniques. I in corperated random song lyrics in my text file instead of random words.
